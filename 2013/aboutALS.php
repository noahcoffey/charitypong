			<h1>About ALS &amp; How It Affects Us</h1>
			<p>This event is organized by a small group of people who are personally affected by ALS in some way. Family members, friends, co-workers-- we have come together to put on a fun, positive, and unique event to help raise funds for an organization that is so important to us.</p>

	            <h2>What is ALS?</h2>
	            <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), often referred to as "Lou Gehrig's disease," is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually lead to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. With voluntary muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.</p>
	            
	            <p><strong>ALS can strike anyone, and the average person lives 2-5 years after being diagnosed.</strong></p>

	            <p>"My mother-in-law was diagnosed with ALS in September of 2010 and passed after battling the disease on December 29, 2011. My wife and I were lucky enough to have the ability to care for her in our home during the last several months. The ALS Center was a huge help during this time. They provide such amazing resources for those stricken with the disease as well as the families. From researching for a cure to lending out very helpful home-aid products for free, any money that is raised can make a significant impact on the very people affected by ALS directly."</p>

	            <h2>How it affects Molly</h2>
	            <p>"My first experience with the ALS Walk was in 2007, when my father was in the final stages of the disease. Although confined to a wheel chair, he welcomed other walkers and fighters with such inspiring enthusiasm and optimism. With the support of family, friends, and coworkers, the 'Borter Bunch' had the largest team attending the event that year and raised $10,000 for the cause. I can still see the expression of appreciation and honor in his eyes as he was asked to lead the Walk. He passed away only a year after diagnosis, just twenty-two days after meeting his newborn triplet granddaughters. I raise awareness for the cause so patients and their relatives now and in the future have the same unwavering support my father and family did. With no known cause or cure, ALS can affect anyone: it’s the horrific and uncertain reality of this disease that’s certainly worth fighting for."</p>
